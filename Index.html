                1. THEIR FEET WORK LIKE SALAD TONGS.  
            </h3>
            <p>Most lizards have fairly unremarkable feet.In the majority of species, they're comprised of
            four to five toes that can move independently of each other—just as ours do. But evolution has
            taken chameleon limbs in a very different direction. A chameleon’s foot consists of two fleshy
            pads that oppose each other. One pad contains three digits that are fused together while the
            other has two fused digits.

            </h2>
            <p>
                Currently, there are around 200 different chameleon species, 44 percent of which can be found
                on Madagascar—leading some experts to wonder if the whole chameleon family originally evolved
                there (although a modern analysis deemed mainland Africa a more likely origin point). Elsewhere
                in the world, some members of this incredible group occur naturally in India, Asia minor, southern
                Europe, and mainland Africa.

            </h2>
            <p>
                In 2012, researchers discovered a new species of chameleon that—as of this writing—is the smallest
                on record. Known as Brookesia micra, the diminutive animal dwells on Nosy Hara, an islet off the
                coast of Madagascar. The diurnal lizard’s maximum adult length is only an inch, and juveniles can
                fit on the head of a match. (Sure, it's a cliche, but ... really. They can.) Meanwhile, mainland
                Madagascar is home to the two largest chameleons on record: the Oustalet’s chameleon and the
                Parson’s chameleon, each of which can grow up to 27 inches.

                1. THERE ARE DIFFERENT TYPES OF CAMELS
            </h2>
            <p>
                All camels are sandy colored with long legs, big lips and a snout, and a distinctive humped back.
                There are two types of camels: Bactrian camels and Dromedary camels. They are very similar, except
                for one difference: Dromedary camels have one hump, while Bactrian camels have two humps. Camels
                are native to desert environments, including the Sahara Desert. They have adapted to the harsh, hot
                and arid environment in several ways. They have three eyelids—one of them is clear, and comes up over
                the eye to protect it from sand and sand storms. Camel eyes are also protected from the sand with
                two rows of thick eyelashes. And they can shut their nostrils during sandstorms to protect from
                getting sand up their snouts. Their thick fur protects them from the sun, and their bodies have
                adapted to use water very efficiently.
            </p>
            <h2>
                2.CAMELS ARE NOT PICKY EATERS.
            </h2> 
            
            <p>
                Camels are definitely not picky eaters, which is a good trait as food and water can be scarce in
                the desert. Typically, camels are fed grass, grains, wheat, and oats. When food is scarce in the
                desert, camels can survive on dried leaves and seeds, and they will even eat leather. Camels can
                also eat thorny plants without getting injured, thanks to their thick lips and their 34 teeth.
                Their stomachs are also divided into three compartments to help them digest this unique diet. One
                thing you won’t catch them eating, though, is meat—camels are herbivores. 
            </p>
            <h2>
            3. CAMELS STORE THINGS IN THEIR HUMPS AND THEIR SLEEP SCHEDULE IS AS MESSED UP AS US IN LOCKDOWN.   
            </h2>

            <p>
                Camels do sleep. They actually can sleep standing up, which helps keep them safe from predators.
                They sleep about six hours per night, and can withstand major temperature changes from the sweltering
                heat of the day to the cold desert nights. Wild camels roam for food at night and rest during the
                hot day.One of the most distinctive features about camels is the one or two humps on their backs.
                A common myth is that the hump stores water—instead, the hump stores fat, which is metabolized when
                food is scarce. In fact, a camel hump is 99% body fat to be precise. And Camels can actually survive
                up to six months without food or water, thanks to their humps. When food and water are available,
                camels eat and drink large amounts to store up for leaner times.

                1.THEY COME IN DROVES.
            </h2>
            <p>
                Periodical cicadas — the ones with 13- or 17-year cycles — first made an appearance in scientific
                literature about 300 years ago. These cicadas are distinct from the ones that make an appearance
                every summer. The periodical cicadas remain juveniles for more than a decade until hormones kick
                in and turn them into adults.There are several "broods" or groups of these cicadas across the
                eastern United States. Each brood emerges in the same year and in approximately the same geographical
                area — sometimes a small area, and sometimes a larger one.   
            </p>
            <h2>
            2. WE HAVE A STRANGE COMMON ANCESTOR. 
            </h2>
            <p>
                All cicada species in North America came from a common ancestor. In a surprising find to biologists,
                these cicadas are most closely related to species in Australia and southeast Asia — not the more
                geographically close species in South America.Periodical species are divided into three groups:
                decula, cassini and decim. Whereas they all came from a common ancestor, the groups began diverging
                from one another about 4 million years ago. Most cicada broods include species from all three of these
                groups. The most recent divergences took place as early as 500,000 years ago, which is considered to
                be just a blip in the Earth's history. Early humans were making fire at about the same time. 
            </p>
            <h2>
            3. THEY SWITCH SIDES. 
            </h2>
            <p>
                Occasionally, a cicada species switches from being on a 13-year cycle to a 17-year cycle.
                The reasons are poorly understood, but it has been recorded happening after a 17-year emergence
                was particularly dense.One example, revealed by genetics, showed 17-year cicadas in the Midwest
                that changed to a 13-year life cycle. Biologists surveyed several broods in that area using
                mitochondrial DNA and other biological "markers" that delineate different species.They discovered
                part of a brood of 13-year cicadas (Brood 14) was the same, genetically speaking, as a 17-year
                brood (Brood 10). This means that switching emergence times could lead to the formation of new
                broods of cicadas.

            </h2>
            <p>
                Since giant predators like sabre-tooth tigers are no longer around, pandas didn't need to be
                as fast, and turned into vegetarian specialists to avoid becoming extinct themselves.We all
                know them as eating only bamboo, but they like some fruit too, and can eat meat. One panda
                park we visited had a photo of a panda devouring a vulture. Although they still have sharp
                teeth and the digestive tract of carnivores, they don't have the energy to chase anything,
                so their prey would virtually have to land in their lap, or be injured and too slow to escape.

            2. YOU CAN SEE PANDA BABIES IN AUGUST.  
            </h2>
            <p>
                Pandas are usually born in August, because the panda's mating months are March to May and
                gestation is 3 to 5 months.Females mainly produce two offspring, but only the stronger one
                survives in the wild. In the research bases in Chengdu, the other twin is hand-reared, and
                swapped regularly with the mother so she can raise two cubs each pregnancy. Some of the money
                you pay in entrance fees funds this successful project.

                "Pandas are said to have a predilection for copper and iron. They really seem to enjoy licking
                every scrap of food from their metal bowls, even turning the bowl in their two dexterous paws.
                An ancient reputation as a licker and eater of copper and iron came from a liking for dishes or
                cooking pots in dwellings of Chinese peasants."
                — from "The Giant Panda" by David Taylor, an interesting source if you want to know more.
                Imagine you were living in a remote mountain dwelling, and the first time you see a giant panda,
                with claws and teeth as big as your fingers, is when it has come to your house to eat... You'd
                probably be terrified and let it lick your pots!Another strange behaviour, but with a modern twist,
                we witnessed, is them enjoying "fruit lollipops" — fruit frozen in a metal dish of water to cool
                them down in the heat of summer in Chengdu.

            <p>
                Pigeons' homing talents continued to shape history during the 20th century. In both World Wars,
                rival nations had huge flocks of pigeon messengers. (America alone had 200,000 at its disposal
                in WWII.) By delivering critical updates, the avians saved thousands of human lives. One racing
                bird named Cher Ami completed a mission that led to the rescue of 194 stranded U.S. soldiers on
                October 4, 1918.

                In a 2016 study, scientists showed that pigeons can differentiate between strings of letters and
                actual words. Four of the birds built up a vocabulary of between 26 and 58 written English words,
                and though the birds couldn't actually read them, they could identify visual patterns and therefore
                tell them apart. The birds could even identify words they hadn't seen before.

            <p>
                Only mammals produce genuine milk, but pigeons and doves (along with some other species of birds)
                feed their young with something similar—a whitish liquid filled with nutrients, fats, antioxidants,
                and healthy proteins called "crop milk." Both male and female pigeons create the milk in the crop,
                a section of the esophagus designed to store food temporarily. As is the case with mammal milk, the
                creation of crop milk is regulated by the hormone prolactin.

            <p>
                The word or name ‘teddy bear’ comes from the nickname of Theodore Roosevelt. He, of course, was a
                former president of the United States of America. Roosevelt was in office from September 12, 1901,
                to March 4, 1909. While the president was in office his nickname became ‘Teddy’, much to his
                displeasure, after a hunting incident. According to sources, in November of 1902, Roosevelt, along
                with other gentlemen, went hunting. Roosevelt failed to hunt down an animal, so members of his group
                decided to tie an American black bear to a tree for him to kill – but thankfully he refused!

                A Canadian soldier bought a black bear cub from a hunter during World War I, and the animal became
                a pet and mascot for his troop. The bear, named Winnipeg, later was given to the London Zoological
                Gardens, where Christopher Robin Milne, Winnie-the-Pooh author A.A. Milne’s son, took such a liking
                to her that he named his teddy bear after her. Don’t miss these compelling reasons to re-read Winnie

                The smallest commercially available stitched teddy bear is a mere 0.29 inches tall, made by South African
                “microbear” maker Cheryl Moss, whose largest creations are just taller than half an inch.But the largest
                towers way, way above them. The world’s largest stitched teddy bear was made in 2008 in America, where
                bigger is better. The 55-foot-4 creation is named C.T.Dreams, which stands for Connect the Dreams, and you
